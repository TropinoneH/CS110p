1. **\_mm_load_si128**:

   - Loads a 128-bit value from aligned memory (16-byte aligned).
   - Syntax: `__m128i _mm_load_si128 (__m128i const * p);`

2. **\_mm_loadu_si128**:

   - Loads a 128-bit value from unaligned memory (no alignment requirement).
   - Syntax: `__m128i _mm_loadu_si128 (__m128i const * p);`

3. **\_mm_load_pd**:

   - Loads two double-precision floating-point values from aligned memory (16-byte aligned).
   - Syntax: `__m128d _mm_load_pd (double const * p);`

4. **\_mm_load1_pd**:
   - Loads a single double-precision floating-point value and replicates it to both elements of the destination register.
   - Syntax: `__m128d _mm_load1_pd (double const * p);`
